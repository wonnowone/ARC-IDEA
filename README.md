🚀 **Advanced hierarchical architecture for ARC problem solving, combining Expected Free Energy optimization with Mixture of Experts and contrastive learning.**

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Hierarchical Multi-Level Design
```
Level 1: Enhanced Solvers (Strategy & Decision-making)
    ├── EnhancedColorPatternSolver
    ├── EnhancedShapeSymmetrySolver  
    ├── EnhancedGeometricTransformSolver
    ├── EnhancedLogicalRuleSolver
    └── EnhancedSymbolicSolver
           ↓
Level 2: MoE Router (Expert Selection & Coordination)
    ├── GridAnalyzer: Comprehensive grid analysis
    ├── ExpertSelector: Multi-strategy expert selection
    ├── GatingNetwork: Neural routing decisions
    └── ExpertCombiner: Multi-expert result fusion
           ↓
Level 3: Movement Experts (Atomic Transformations)
    ├── FlipExpert: Horizontal, vertical, diagonal flips
    ├── RotationExpert: 90°, 180°, 270° rotations
    ├── TranslationExpert: Spatial shifts with boundary handling
    └── ColorTransformExpert: Color swaps, mappings, gradients
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Declarative Movement Language
```python
script = MovementScript(name="adaptive_transformation")
script.add_flip(axis='horizontal', 
               conditions=[(MovementCondition.HAS_SYMMETRY, 'horizontal')])
script.add_color_swap(color1=1, color2=2)
script.add_conditional(
    condition=(MovementCondition.COLOR_COUNT, 2),
    true_instruction=color_swap_instruction
)
```

### 2. Comprehensive Loss Function
```python
L_total = L_EFE + λ_contrast×L_contrastive + λ_ambiguity×ambiguity_penalty + λ_chaos×L_chaos
```

**Where:**
- **L_EFE**: 정합성 (Risk: D_KL + Ambiguity: -log P(constraints|output))
- **L_contrastive**: 명확성 (InfoNCE loss for consensus vs failed outputs)  
- **L_ambiguity**: 일치성 유도 (Penalty for solver disagreement)
- **L_chaos**: 유연성 확보 (Controlled diversity maintenance)

### 3. Multi-Level Consensus Mechanism
- **Solver-Level**: Majority voting among high-level solvers
- **Movement-Level**: Expert consensus for atomic operations
- **Hierarchical EFE**: Combined optimization across all levels

### 4. Enhanced Learning System
- **Z-Learning**: Risk minimization through preference updates
- **Contrastive Learning**: Positive/negative example discrimination  
- **Movement Sequence Learning**: Pattern recognition from successful traces
- **Expert Specialization**: Dynamic expertise allocation
