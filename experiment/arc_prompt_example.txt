# Example Application: Pattern Completion Challenge

## Phase 1: Problem Objective Definition

### Input-Output Analysis:
Input: 3x3 grid with partial blue line
Output: 3x3 grid with completed blue line

### Objective Statement:
"The goal is to complete broken or partial lines of the same color to form continuous straight lines."

### Self-Critique:
- Consistent across examples?  All examples show line completion
- Captures essential transformation?  Focus is on line continuity
- Edge cases considered? Need to check diagonal lines and corners

## Phase 2: Forward Chain-of-Thought Planning

### Grid Analysis Example:
Input:  [0,1,0]
        [0,0,0]  
        [0,1,0]

Output: [0,1,0]
        [0,1,0]
        [0,1,0]

### Transformation Steps:
1. **Pixel (1,1)**: 0 ï¿½ 1
   - **Why**: Creates vertical line continuity
   - **What**: Fills gap between existing blue pixels
   - **How**: Completes the vertical line pattern
   - **Consistency**: Matches line completion objective

### Rule Formalization:
- **Condition**: When pixels of same color are aligned with a gap
- **Action**: Fill the gap with the same color
- **Scope**: Direct line connections (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- **Constraints**: Only fill single-pixel gaps

## Phase 3: Reverse Thinking Validation

### Output-to-Input Reasoning:
Starting with completed line [0,1,0; 0,1,0; 0,1,0]:
- To create input, remove middle pixel: [0,1,0; 0,0,0; 0,1,0]
- This creates a gap that needs completion
- Reverse rule: "Identify incomplete lines and their missing segments"

### Validation:
- **Necessity**: Middle pixel necessary for line completion 
- **Sufficiency**: This step alone completes the pattern 
- **Consistency**: Forward and backward reasoning align 

## Phase 4: Self-Critique and Refinement

### Quality Assessment:
- **Logical**: Line completion is logical 
- **Complete**: All changes explained 
- **Simple**: Straightforward line completion rule 
- **Generalizable**: Should work for other line patterns 

## Phase 5: Final Application

### Test Input Application:
Apply line completion rule to test input systematically, checking each potential gap against the learned pattern.
